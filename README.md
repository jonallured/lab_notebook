# Lab Notes

I was inspired by [this blog post][post] to start keeping a lab notebook and
couldn't resist creating some tools to make it easier. This repo contains the
scripts I use to keep a lab notebook, but you might also want to check out
[`vim-lab-notes`][vim] where I have further improved my tools by integrating
with my editor of choice.

## Write things down

What I realized is that I already DO THIS. I open my editor and type out some
notes to myself all the time. But I never save them. Once written and I no
longer need those notes, I just end up deleting the file. Often I never even
saved the file to begin with!!

Or other times I make a list of things that I need to do - what class needs to
be refactored still, where I've hard-coded a value that needs to be extracted
and once I work through this list, I delete it.

## Keep your notes

I don't always need to refer back to these notes, but sometimes I do and while
recreating them is possible, it's silly to not just save them. You never know
what you'll want to look back at, so don't even think about it - save
everything!

## Organizing notes

In order to make your notes more valuable, tag them - even something as simple
as adding a tag for the project you're working on that triggered the note. Or
tag notes that pertain to a service with the name of that service. Maybe tag
things that you found while Googling as research. Also, star the ones that
you're going to need frequently or that you refer to often.
