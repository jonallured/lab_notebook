I always forget how to format times, this is the site to reference:

```
http://www.foragoodstrftime.com/
```

Just kidding, this one is even better:

```
http://www.strfti.me/
```

And then all this stuff inspired me to write this TIL:

```
https://til.hashrocket.com/posts/6ffc3e1e98-the-case-of-meridian-in-rubys-strftime
```

I just think it's hilarious that no one involved with this API stopped to
consider how dumb it is that the case of the flag and the case of the output are
reversed. That's just dumb.
